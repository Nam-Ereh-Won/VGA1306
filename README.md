# VGA1306 (VGA-out for DIY Arduboys implemented on an FPGA!)

VGA1306.v & VGA1306.pcf are for the SSD1306 Emulation

DMG1306.v & DMG1306.pcf are for the GameBoy VGA-out Implementation!

VGA1306_CS.v & VGA1306_CS.pcf are a varation of the SSD1306 Emulation, allowing for correct use of the CS (chip select) pin, in case there are other devices sharing the SPI bus.
